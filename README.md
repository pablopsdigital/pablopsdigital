# Hi, I'm Pablo Pérez 👋

![Pablo Pérez - pablopsdigital.com](https://github.com/pablopsdigital/pablopsdigital/blob/master/img/github-header.png)

I`m **Product Designer and Software Developer** who is passionate about combining design and development to create digital products that people like. I combine these _two passions_ 📐👨🏽‍💻 across different multimedia disciplines, mainly _UX-UI_, _3d development tools_, and _web development_.

I have participated in projects using different languages ​​such as Python, Java, Dart, Kotlin, QT, C#, Processing, etc. Mainly focused on the development of 3D pipeline tools, interactive products and augmented reality applications.

Currently I enjoy designing digital products oriented to web technologies such as **Vue**, **React**, **Node**, **Express**, **Mongo** or **GraphQL**.

🔭 For me it would be interesting to collaborate on projects where I can develop my skills, especially I seek to improve in the front-end and the development of **design systems** as a strategic component of business and company culture.
